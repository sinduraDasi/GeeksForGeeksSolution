Given an integer array a[] of size n, find the highest element of the array. The array will either be strictly increasing or strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing.

Note: a[i] != a[i+1] 

Example 1:

Input:
11
1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1
Output: 
6
Explanation: 
Highest element of array a[] is 6.
Example 2:

Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output:
5
Explanation: 
Highest element of array a[] is 5.
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findPeakElement() which takes the array a[] as the input parameter and returns the highest element of the array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(n))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
2 <= n <= 106
1 <= a[i] <= 106

Solution:

class Solution:
	def findPeakElement(self, a):
		# Code here
		n=len(a)
	    l,r=0,n-1
	    mid=(l+r)//2
	    maxi=0
	    while l<=r:
	        if a[mid]==maxi:
	            return a[mid]
	        elif a[l]<=a[r]:
	            maxi=a[r]
	            l+=1
	        elif a[r]<=a[l]:
	            maxi=a[l]
	            r-=1
	        else:
	           maxi=a[l]
	           l+=1
	    return maxi
